This software is designed to run on ubuntu, but can be configured to run on most
distributions. You will need nodejs and redis-server in order to get started.
https://nodejs.org/en/
https://redis.io/
Both are available from apt-get:
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install redis-server

From the root of the unpacked zipfile, you will then need to install the dependencies
of the software:
$ npm install

The software is now ready to run on the default port (9090). If you would like to change
any configuration settings, please edit the User Interface/conf.json file. To change what
endpoints are cached, please edit the User Interface/auroraEndpoints.json file.

Several scripts are provided for your convenience:
User Interface/cache-connect.sh - connect to the redis command prompt
User Interface/cache-flush.sh - flush the cache
User Interface/cache-info.sh - report cache hits and misses

If you have any questions, please email <s@watz.ky> and I will get back to you as
soon as possible.

To start the cache server, execute:
$ node User\ Interface/startup.js
